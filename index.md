## Why enroll?

With new AI-based technologies that power almost all activities in the digital world, cybercrime is on an unprecedented increase. Forensics is the science of tracing causes, methods and perpetrators from evidence, once a crime has been committed. This course will teach you some of the key technologies that are helping investigative and law enforcement agencies to police cybercrimes and track cybercriminals.
